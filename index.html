<h1> About Ryan :) </h1>

<p> My family consists of my mom, my dad, and my sister. I like to play video games, watch tv, and I love to play soccer. Some of my skills include using computer technology such as microsoft and google programs.</p>
 
    <h2>Photoshop Magazine Cover</h2>
    <p>I liked this project because it was really fun. I liked being able to design a magazine cover because we got to put whatever we want on the cover.</p>

    <h2>That One Place Ice Cream Logo</h2>
    <p>This was a fun project because I got to design a logo for an imaginary ice cream company. It was fun because we got to use shapes to make the buildings in the background and make the ice cream scoops. We also got to name the resturant.</p>

    <h2>ATM Board Game</h2>
    <p>This was a fun project because we got to make a board game and include things in it that we have done throughout the year. We got to put things in it like a goal to reach, for example I put the World Cup Trophy as the goal.</p>
